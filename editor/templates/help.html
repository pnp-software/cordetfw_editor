  <p class="lead">Web-based editor to support the specification of a service-oriented software application</p>
</div>

<div class="container-fluid bg-grey">
    <p>
    The editor provides an environment where users can specify their service-oriented applications.
    The editor explicitly supports the service concept of the 
    <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/cordetfw">Cordet Framework</a> but can also be used independently
    of the framework as a generic requirements capture tool.
    </p><p>
    The data managed by the editor are stored in a database held on a server.
    The processing of the editor data is done by a back-end running on the server.
    The rendering of the editor data is done by a front-end running on a client machine.
    </p><p>
    The Cordet FW Editor lets users create an <strong>instance</strong> of a specification for their applications.
    The editor enforces a <strong>model</strong> of how this specification instance is built.
    The model has two parts: a static part which defines the structure of the editor database; 
    and a dynamic part which defines the behaviour associated to the data held in the database.
    The editor behaviour is implemented in the back-end component of the editor.
    </p>
 
   
    <h3>Editor Access</h3>
    <p>
    Access to the editor is for members only. 
    Prospective users apply for membership by contacting the <a href="mailto:pnp-software@pnp-software.com">administrator</a>.
    Members are given a user name and an initial password (which they are expected to change after the first log-in) and they
    are allocated to one or more <i>projects</i>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Database Model</h3>
    <p>
    The editor database models the following concepts:
    <ul>
    <li>Users</li>
    <li>Projects</li>
    <li>Applications</li>
    <li>Releases</li>
    <li>Specification Items</li>
    <li>ValSets</li>
    </ul>
    The <strong>users</strong> are the entities interacting with the editor.
    An admin user is responsible for administration tasks; other users are responsible for populating
    the database.
    Each user is allocated to a project (but the same user may be allocated to multiple projects).
    Each user may have different <a href"#UserRoles">roles</a> within a project defining different 
    levels of access to the project artifacts.
    </p><p>
    A <strong>project</strong> is the top-level container for a specification created by the editor users.
    It consists of a set of <strong>applications</strong>.
    Each specification item belongs either to a project (in which case it is common to all applications
    within the project) or it belongs to an application within a project.
    </p><p>
    Both projects and applications may have multiple <a href"#Releases"><strong>releases</strong></a>.
    A project release is identified by a non-negative integer.
    An application release is identified by a pair "x.y" where 'x' is the release identifier of the
    project to which the application belongs and 'y' is a non-negative integer.
    </p><p>
    A <a href="#SpecItems"><strong>specification item</strong></a> is the lowest-level item managed by the editor.
    Specification items are created, edited and deleted by the users.
    A specification item could, for instance, consist of an application requirement, or of the definition
    of a data item, or of a model used to describe part of an application behaviour.
    </p><p>
    A <strong>ValSet</strong> is a set of values for the specification items within a project.
    The "Default" ValSet is pre-defined.
    A project may have additional ValSet representing alternative values for some of their specification items.
    Each specification value is assigned to a ValSet.
    To illustrate, let specification item S1 be assigned to the Default ValSet.
    Suppose that there is a need to maintain a variant of specification item S1. This could, for instance,
    be due to the fact that the system which is being specified in the editor exists in two slightly
    dfferent variants, which differ from each other in having two different instances of specification item S1.
    In such a scenario, a second ValSet can be created to hold the specification items which have different
    formulations for the alternative variant of the system.
    </p>
    
    <h4><a name="SpecItems">Specification Items</a></h4>
    <p>
    Specification items are defined by their attributes and by the behaviour associated to them
    (i.e. by the way they are handled by the editor).
    Specification items are divided into <strong>categories</strong>. 
    Specification items in the same category have the same behaviour associated to them (i.e. they are
    treated in the same way by the editor).    
    </p><p>
    Some specification item attributes (the <strong>core attributes</strong>) have a semantics which is
    independent of the specification item category.
    Other specification item attributes have a category-specific semantics.
    </p><p>
    Within a project, a specification item is identified by the pair: <strong>domain:name</strong>. 
    The domain is used to capture a set of logically related specification items and acts as a kind
    of name space.
    The name is unique within the domain.
    </p><p>
    The editor keeps track of the <a href="#History"><strong>history</strong></a> of specification 
    items by maintaining different copies
    of the specification item reflecting the temporal evolution of the specification item.
    The history mechanism is supported by the 
    <strong>update time</strong> attribute representing the time when the specification time was last updated
    and by the <strong>previous</strong> attribute which points to the previous version of the specification item. 
    </p><p>
    Each specification item has an owner, which is the user who last updated the specification item.
    </p><p>
    Some categories of specification item may play different roles or may have different kinds.
    This is captured by the 'Kind' attribute.
    </p><p>
    Some specification item may have an attribute which takes on non-negative integer values (e.g. a size or dimenstion.
    </p><p>
    Each specification item has a short description (its <strong>title</strong>) and it may have a long
    description (its <strong>description</strong>). Specification items may have a <strong>value</strong>.
    </p><p>
    Some categories of specification items are in a parent-child relationship (e.g. a packet parameter
    belongs to a packet -- the packet is the "parent" of the packet parameter).      
    </p><p>
    Thus, in summary, the core attributes of specification items are 
    (asterisked attributes are mandatory; the others may be left empty):
    <ul>
    <li><i>Domain(*)</i>: the domain to which the specification item belongs</li>
    <li><i>Name(*)</i>: the name of the specification item (unique within the domain)</li>
    <li><i>Project(*)</i>: the project to which the specification item belongs </li>
    <li><i>Application</i>: the application to which the specification item belongs (empty if the specification
                     item describes a project-level feature)</li>
    <li><i>Category(*)</i>: the category of the specification item</li>
    <li><i>Title(*)</i>: a short description of the specification item</li>
    <li><i>Description</i>: a long description of the specification item</li>
    <li><i>Value</i>: the value of the specification item</li>
    <li><i>Parent</i>: the higher-level specification item to which this specification item is attached</li>
    <li><i>Owner(*)</i>: the name of the user who created the specification item</li>
    <li><i>Status(*)</i>: the history status of the speecification item</li>
    <li><i>Kind</i>: the kind of the specification item within its category</li>
    <li><i>Dim</i>: a non-negative attribute of a specification item</li>
    <li><i>Update Time(*)</i>: the time when the specification item was created or when the 
                            history status of the specification was last updated</li>
    <li><i>Previous</i>: the pointer to the previous version of a specification item which has been modified 
                                 (empty if the specification item has no history)</li>
    <li><i>Justification</i>: the rationale for the existence of the specification item or for its value</li>
    <li><i>Remarks</i>: any remarks applicable to the specification item</li> 
    <li><i>ValSet</i>: the <a href="#ValSets">ValSet</a> to which the specification item belongs</li> 
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="EditorBehaviour">Editor Behaviour</a></h3>
    <p>
    The following sub-sections describe various aspects of the editor behaviour.
    
    <h4><a name="UserRoles">User Roles</a></h4>
    <p>
    There are two types of users: the <strong>admin user</strong> and <strong>basic users</strong>.
    </p><p>
    The <strong>admin user</strong> is responsible for: 
    <ul>
    <li>Creating and managing basic users</li>
    <li>Creating projects and assigning their owner</li>
    <li>Assigning basic users to a project</li>
    <li>Defining the ValSets for the specification items of a project</li>
    </ul>
    The <strong>basic users</strong> (or just "users" for short) manage the project and the specification items they contain 
    in accordance with their roles.
    Within a project, a user has one of two roles:
    <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Project Owner</strong> is appointed by the admin user when the project is created.
    The project owner can: 
        <ul>
        <li>Create and edit applications within the project</li>
        <li>Make a new release of a project or of one of its applications</li>
        <li>Create new specification items in the project </li>
        <li>Edit, view, copy and delete the specification items in the project </li>
        </ul>
    <li>The <strong>Project User</strong> is allocated to a project by the admin user.
    The project user can: 
        <ul>
        <li>Create new specification items within the project </li>
        <li>Edit, view, copy and delete specification items in the project</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    A user can be assigned (either as owner or as plain user) to multiple projects.
    </p>
    
    
    <h4><a name="Releases">Release Mechanism</a></h4>
    <p>
    The release number of a project is a non-negative integer.
    The release number of an application has the form "x.y", where 'x' is the release number of the
    project to which the application belongs and 'y' is a non-negative number. 
    The release numbers of projects and applications are set according to the rules stated below.:
    <ul>
    <li>When a project is created, its release number x if set to zero</li>
    <li>When an application is created the y component of its release number is set to zero</li>
    <li>When the project owner makes a new release of a project, its release number is incremented by 1
    and the y component of the release number of its applications is set to zero</li>
    <li>When the project owner makes a new release of an applicatioin, 
    the y component of the release number of the application is incremented by 1</li>
    </ul>
    A textual description may be attached to each release.
    A release of a project or of an application causes the history status of the specification items
    in the project or application to be updated as described <a href="#History">below</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <h4><a name="History">History Mechanism</a></h4>
    <p>
    Specification items carry history information through the following attributes:
    (a) the owner; (b) the status; (c) the previous pointer; and (d) the update time.
    The status is one of the following:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>New</strong>: the item has been created in the current release</li>
        <li><strong>Modified </strong>: the item was created in a previous release and has been modified in the current release</li>
        <li><strong>Confirmed</strong>: the item was created in a previous release and has not been modified in the current release</li>
        <li><strong>Obsolete</strong>: the item was created in a previous release and has since been modified</li>
        <li><strong>Deleted</strong>: the item was created in a previous release and has since been deleted</li>
        </ul>
    The status information evolves according to the logic in the state diagram:

    <h4><a name="#SpecItemOper">Operations Performed on Specification Items</a></h4>
    <p>
    TBD
    </p>
    
    <h4><a name="ValSets">ValSets</a></h4>
    The editor allows multiple set of values to be assigned to the same specification item.  
    A set of values for the specification values is called a <i>ValSet</i>.
    The admin user defines the range of ValSets for each project. 
    The 'Default' ValSet is pre-defined for all projects. 
    </p><p>
    The ValSet attribute of a specification item is used to manage the ValSets: 
    when the specification item is created, it is allocated to the Default ValSet.
    The user can then create new instances of the same specification item 
    belonging to one of the other ValSets defined for the project to which the specification_item belongs. 
    </p><p>
    The ValSet is managed as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>when a new specification item is created, its ValSet is set to 'Default'</li>
    <li>When a specification item is edited, its ValSet remains unchanged</li>
    <li>When a specification item is copied, the ValSet of the newly created copy can be set freely</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    

    <h4><a name="IntRef">Internal References</a></h4>
    <p>
    TBD
    </p>    
    
   
    
    <h4><a name="BehaviouralModels">Behavioural Models</a></h4>
    <p>
    Behavioural models are implemented as state machine or procedure models generated with the 
    <a href="https://www.pnp-software.com/fwprofile/editor">FW Profile Editor</a>.
    The FW Profile Editor stores models in a database (the <i>FW Profile Editor Database</i>).
    Each model has an owner who is identified by its e-mail address.
    Within the FW Profile Editor, models have a name and can have a domain and a title.
    Models are defined as json strings and an svg representation which can be used to render them as pictures.
    </p><p>
    The Cordet FW Editor has a connection to FW Profile Editor Database and it allows a user to import all the models 
    corresponding to one or more domains.
    In response to an import request, the Cordet FW Editor retrieves the FW Profile Models of the selected domains from the FW Profile Editor
    Database and imports them into a dedicated table (the <i>FwProfileModel</i> table) in the Cordet FW Editor Database. 
    The import function processes each imported model according to the following rules:
    <ul>
    <li>If an entry exists in the FwProfileModel table with the same domain and name as the imported model, and if the status of this entry is
        'CNF', and if the imported entry is identical to the local entry, then nothing is done.</li>
    <li>If an entry exists in the FwProfileModel table with the same domain and name as the imported model, and if the status of this entry is
        'CNF', and if the imported entry differs from the local entry, then the status of the local entry is changed from 'CNF' to 'OBS' and
        a new record is created in the FwProfileModel table to hold the imported model. The status of the newly created entry is set to 'NEW'
        and its 'previous' field is set to point to the old entry.</li>
    <li>If an entry exists in the FwProfileModel table with the same domain and name as the imported model, and if the status of this entry is
        'NEW', then the entry is overwritten with the imported data.</li>
    <li>In all other cases, 
        a new record is created in the FwProfileModel table to hold the imported model. The status of the newly created entry is set to 'NEW'
        and its 'previous' field is set to 'None'.</li>
    </ul>
    In the second and third case, an error is issued if more than one entry is found with the same domain:name:status combination is found.
